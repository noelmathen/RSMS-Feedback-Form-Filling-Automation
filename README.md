# Feedback Automation Script

This Python script uses Selenium to automate the feedback submission process on the [Rajagiri Tech Student Portal](https://www.rajagiritech.ac.in/stud/ktu/student/). It specifically targets the feedback pages for the 2023 End Semester Feedback ODD.

## Features

- **User Input:** The script prompts the user to enter their username and password for the student portal.
- **Error Handling:** The script includes error handling to catch exceptions during the automation process and print informative error messages.
- **Headless Mode:** The script uses a headless browser for a more seamless automation experience.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Chrome Browser

## Usage

1. Enter your student portal username and password when prompted.
2. The script will automatically navigate to the selected feedback page, fill in feedback for each subject, and submit it.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the Chrome browser installed on your machine.
- The script may need adjustments if the HTML structure of the feedback pages changes.
